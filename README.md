# Study of the combination of modalities and coherence for the ReID of participants in  Ultra-Running  Scenario.


In the context of ultra-running, verification of participant's identities is necessary in order to 
avoid cheating and irregularities, and for safety and regulatory reasons the position of the runners 
must be known. In this context, state-of-the-art whole-body based re-identification approaches have 
reported moderate success due to challenging scenario characteristics such as: lighting or clothing 
changes. In this project, we explored different deep learning and machine learning techniques applied to
ReID using as features: the body, the face and a combination of both. In addition, we investigate the 
use of contextual information to reduce the gallery size, and therefore improve the overall re-identification performance.
